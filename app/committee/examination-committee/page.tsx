            The Examination Committee is a vital body within educational institutions responsible for overseeing all aspects related to examinations. Comprising faculty members, administrators, and sometimes external experts, the committee ensures the smooth and fair conduct of examinations. It formulates examination policies, schedules, and guidelines, adhering to academic regulations and standards. The committee designs question papers, coordinates examination logistics, and arranges invigilation teams. After the exams, it oversees the evaluation process, results compilation, and grade allocation. Additionally, the Examination Committee handles student grievances related to examinations and works diligently to uphold the integrity and credibility of the examination system, contributing to a robust and reliable assessment process.
